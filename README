Algorithm-NeedlemanWunsch

This module implements the Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment
algorithm - similar to finding the longest common subsequence (as used
e.g. in Algorithm::Diff), but with finer-grained control over which
mismatches are most serious and which matches most desirable.

The algorithm is described at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman-Wunsch
